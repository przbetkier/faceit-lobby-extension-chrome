## Faceit-lobby-extension [Google Chrome] 

![Logo](src/icons/icon48.png)

This is a tool which helps during map picking on Faceit CS:GO matches. The extension provides additional information about queued players performance on particular maps, thus it should help in making more thought-out decision about which map should be played or banned in the first place.
